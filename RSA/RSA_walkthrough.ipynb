    "The basic idea of RSA is that it is relatively easy to take two prime numbers and multiply them together. It is also relatively easy to raise a number to an exponent and find the modulo of that number for any given base. It is _not_ however so easy to go the other way and determine what two prime numbers were mulitplied together. That is the basic idea behind RSA; your data is safe so long as it takes \"too long\" for someone else to compute what two numbers you used."

For example: take the arithmatic operation of 2 + 3. If your clock has only 4 numbers - you are working (mod 4) - you would start at 2, take 3 steps forward and wind up wrapping back around to 1. Likewise, if you started with the value (2+3)(mod4), it would be represented the same way because modular arithmatic does not depend on the order operations are performed. Let's take a moment to explore how this is implemented in **moduloarithmatic.py**."

In normal math a number times its inverse will result in 1 and a number plus its inverse will result in 0. These numbers 1 and 0 are called identities because if you multiply/ add -respectively - any number by them the result will be the same one you put in. In modulo arithmatic the same is ture, however instead of using negative numbers or fractions we have to rely on the numbers from 1 to n.

If you recall from the introduction (which was admitedly a while ago) the public key is made up of two prime numbers multiplied together. So far we have only been dealing with a single prime number, but there is another method that can be used when two prime numbers are multiplied together, it turns out that the totient will be equal to the totient of the first times the totient of the second. In other words, the totient of _pq_ is equal to _(p-1)(q-1)_. Let's try that out."
