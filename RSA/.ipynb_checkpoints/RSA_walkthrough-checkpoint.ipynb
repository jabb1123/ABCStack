    "The basic idea of RSA is that it is relatively easy to take two prime numbers and multiply them together. It is also relatively easy to raise a number to an exponent and find the modulo of that number for any given base. It is _not_ however so easy to go the other way and determine what two prime numbers were mulitplied together. That is the basic idea behind RSA; your data is safe so long as it takes \"too long\" for someone else to compute what two numbers you used."

For example: take the arithmatic operation of 2 + 3. If your clock has only 4 numbers - you are working (mod 4) - you would start at 2, take 3 steps forward and wind up wrapping back around to 1. Likewise, if you started with the value (2+3)(mod4), it would be represented the same way because modular arithmatic does not depend on the order operations are performed. Let's take a moment to explore how this is implemented in **moduloarithmatic.py**."

In normal math a number times its inverse will result in 1 and a number plus its inverse will result in 0. These numbers 1 and 0 are called identities because if you multiply/ add -respectively - any number by them the result will be the same one you put in. In modulo arithmatic the same is ture, however instead of using negative numbers or fractions we have to rely on the numbers from 1 to n. So let's explore that a little bit in regards to multiplication."
