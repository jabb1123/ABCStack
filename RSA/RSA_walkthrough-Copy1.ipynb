    "The basic idea of RSA is that it is relatively easy to take two prime numbers and multiply them together. It is also relatively easy to raise a number to an exponent and find the modulo of that number for any given base. It is _not_, however, so easy to go the other way and determine what two prime numbers were mulitplied together. That is the basic idea behind RSA; your data is safe so long as it takes \"too long\" for someone else to compute what two numbers you used."

    "The basic idea of modular arithmatic is fairly straightforward. Imagine a circle of numbers, such as a clock, where all operations wrap back around. For example, say it is 9 o'clock. You know that in 4 hours, it will not be 13 o'clock, but 1 o'clock (provided you aren't working in military time). This \"clock arithmatic\" that most of us perform in our everyday lives is really modular arithmatic! The operation you just performed can be represented as 9 + 4 (mod 12) = 1.\n",

    "Similarly, take the operation 2 + 3. If your clock has only 4 numbers [in other words, you are working (mod 4)], you would start at 2, take 3 steps forward, then wrap back around to 1. Likewise, if you started with the value (2+3)(mod4), it would be represented the same way, because modular arithmatic does not depend on the order of the operations that are performed. Let's take a moment to explore how this is implemented in **moduloarithmatic.py**:"

The numbers 1 and 0 are called identities because if you multiply / add any number by them (respecively), the result will be the number you started with. In modular arithmatic, the same is true. However, instead of using negative numbers or fractions, we have to rely on the numbers from 1 to n. Let's explore this in regards to multiplication:"
